## Lords of machines

There is a notion that machines are replacing people.
I think that it is us, software engineers, who are replacing people with machines.
There is a threat though, once machines will become sophisticated enough, they may replace us.
So let's be careful, write good code, with little bugs, more tests, give it correct privileges,
and give no change to machines to raise. Let's stay lords of machines and not the other way around. Cheers.

## Running shoes

Two people are filming a lion for a documentary. When the lion looks up, the men are scared that they have been spotted. At this moment, one of the men puts on a pair of running shoes and his colleagues say, "Those shoes will not help you outrun a lion". Then the man replies, "I do not need to outrun a lion, I only need to outrun you".
