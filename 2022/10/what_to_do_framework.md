# What To Do Framework

[TOC]

## Plan^2

What To Do Now/Next?
Follow the plan.

### Multiple levels

There are multiple plans: for a day, a project, a ticket, a specific issue, etc.

### Start from a plan

For every problem there has to be a plan, if there is no idea what the plan should look like, we can start with this example:

- figure out that to do

  - study the issue
  - check the documentation
  - check the code
  - look for possible solutions
  - write down questions

- update the plan

### Plan is subject to continuous adjustments

Add new points, remove, update, add subsections.

### A difficult problem encountered

If a problem is complicated and takes a lot of time - create a plan for it.

If a problem took 1hr of time and there is no progress - ask for help:

- have to be a single message
- contain the problem description
- links
- expected result
- observed result
- what was tried
- code snippets
- instructions on how to reproduce

### Distractions

After each distraction we need time to recollect what we have been doing and what has to be done next, plan helps to speed up this.

### Anxiety

If something important came to your mind (do not forget to extend a test, run a data migration before deploy, etc.) - add it to the plan (I remember nothing, I write it all).

This will eliminate the fear of forgetting important things.

### Track the amount of work

The amount of work is easier to evaluate, and the remaining time can be estimated.

### Gratification and gamification

Each subtask completed is a small gratification we can receive multiple times a day.

## Not To Do

### YAGNI

You Arent Gonna Need It.
If you are not sure you will need it - don't do.

### Invent the wheel

If got a brilliant idea - it is, probably, implemented, search for libs/services.

### Do what tools can do for you

Invest in tools:

- code formatting (prettier, black)
- code editor functionality
- ipython/jupyter for scripting
- etc.

### What makes you “busy” (email box, instant messages)

Unsubscribe from emails you don't need.
Pause notifications while working.

### Repetitive, not creative work

Outsource.

### Slow

Speed up:

- speed up videos
- skip not important texts
- use threads, vector math, to speed up data loading and processing
- optimize data loading (for example: remove/recreate indexes before loading data, use batch loading)

## AAR

After Action Review.

## Common sense

Not every problem requires a plan.
And how detailed a plan could be is up to the individual preferences.
