# Getting Things Done

## Plan

Plan 90 days at a time.

> If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it's defined.

I don't need to remember, I write it all.

Small wins.

Set up reminders and forget.

Have something tasty for morning.

Next action must be defined.

Share a lists to a team members (feature).

Someday/maybe list.

Weekly review (at the last work day).

External brain.

> Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win.

Frustration, anxiety - because of unfilled commitments.

## Goldratt's framework

See [theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints).

Questions:

- What's the system?
- What's the current limit?
- What's the obvious way to improve the limit?
