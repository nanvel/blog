- Monitoring the health of the system and quickly restoring service if it goes a bad state
- Tracking down the cause of the problem, such as system failures or degraded performance
- Keeping software and platforms up to date, including security patches
- Keeping tabs on how different systems effect each other, so that a problematic change can be avoided before it causes damage
- Anticipating future problems and solving them before they occur (e.g., capacity planning)
- Establishing good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management, and more
- Performing complex maintenance tasks, such as moving an application from one platform to another
- Maintaining the security of the system as configuration changes are made
- Defining process that make operations predictable and help keep the production environment stable
