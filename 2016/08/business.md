## Notes

### You don't learn until you launch

> You don't learn until you launch.
>
> The 7 Day Startup by Dan Norris

According to [Cynefin framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework), in chaotic systems (like business) we need to act first.

### Business success components

Business success components:

- The idea
- Execution
- Ability to get customers
- Timing
- Luck

## Roadmap

### 1. The idea

Collect all ideas you have (go for quantity, not quality) into a list.

> Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have.
>
> Emile Chartier

The idea must be passionate, profitable, scalable.

> It makes no sense to start a business that is going to have you doing work you don't enjoy.
>
> The 7 Day Startup by Dan Norris

Questions:

- Is it enjoyable?
- Is it much me?
- Is it scalable?
- Does it has potential to make a significant impact in its field?
- Is there any original/effective ideas (viral?) to bring leads and convert them to customers?
- How many time it would take to lunch?
- Do you have enough knowledge/talent/passion in the field?

#### Take a look at the Long Tail

The [Long Tail](http://www.longtail.com/about.html) is getting fatter, longer, and more accessible (the internet has changed the rules, revealing new markets and business every day).

### 2. Minimum Viable Product

> The first step is to enter the Build phase as a quickly as possible with a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time.
>
> Eric Ries

An idea for collecting data: web scraping (it may be beneficial for both sides).

### 3. Choose a name

Tricks:

- Use a place/time/state name
- Borrow from your favourite movie/book/comics
- Combine words
- Use an acronym
- Look into dictionary
- Check `.com` domain is available
- Is it simple enough to be spread via word-of-mouth (is it easy to pronounce)?
- Does it has any sense, can you explain it in a few words?

### 4. Build

> A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.
>
> General George S. Patton, Jr.
