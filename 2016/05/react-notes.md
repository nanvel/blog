## Basics

### Props vs state

**props** stores read-only data is passed from the parent.
It belongs to the parent and cannot be changed by its children.
This data should be considered immutable.

**state** stores data that is private to the component.
It can be changed by the component.
The component will rerender itself when the state is updated.
