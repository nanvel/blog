## img title vs image alt

**Alt** text is meant to be an alternative information source for those people who have chosen to disable images in their browsers and those user agents that are simply unable to “see” the images. Google officially confirmed it mainly focuses on alt text when trying to understand what an image is about.

Image **title** should provide additional information and follow the rules of a regular title: it should be relevant, short, catchy, and concise (A title “offers advisory information about the element for which it is set.“).
