## Semantic versioning

Pattern: ```major.minor.patch```.

Example:

```1.0.0``` - initial version.
```1.0.1``` - minor bug fixes, there are no new features was added and interface exactly the same as in previous version.
```1.1.0``` - some new features was added, interface was extended. The API is fully compatible with previous version.
```2.0.0``` - there are changes in the API interface made it icompatable with previous version.

Major version increment == backward incompatibility.
Minor version increment == extended but fully compatible.
Patch version increment == bug fixes.
