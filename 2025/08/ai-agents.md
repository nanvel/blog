# AI Agents

An AI agent is a software system that can perceive its environment,
make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals with some degree of autonomy.

Key characteristics of AI agents include:
- Autonomy
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Environmental awareness
- Decision-making capability
- Learning and adaptation

Human vs agent:
- true cretivity
- common sense
- intuition
- emotional intelligence
- leadership
- ethical oversight

## Design Patterns

AI Agent components:
- LLM
- Prompt
- Memory
- Tools

AI Agent Design Patterns:
- Reflection (self-evaluation)
- Tool Use (tool integration)
- Planning
- Multi-Agent (agent collaboration)

Benefits of multi-agent:
- simpler context management
- shorter prompts
- freedom to choose a provider for each agent individually
- fewer tools -> less confusion
- parallel execution -> less latency (chained -> higher latency)
- easier to test

## Vocabulary

Reasoning - the cognitive process of drawing conclusions, making inferences, and forming judgments based on available information, evidence, or premises. Thinking in a logical way.
