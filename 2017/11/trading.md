## Ideas

Strategies:
- trend following strategies
- mean reversion trading strategies
- statistical arbitrage and pairs trading
- arbitrage ([triangular arbitrage](https://forum.gekko.wizb.it/thread-56746.html))
- market making
- index fund balancing

Doesn't work:

- Buy while price moves down and sell when moves up (
  some times doesn't move up, takes long time,
  requires a lot of base currency that will be locked most of time,
  small profit as trade small pieces)

To try:

- Buy on surges
- Bollinger Band (deviation from moving averages)
- Volume-price charts
- watchers on rich list
- buy before the pay day (people accumulating from salaries)
- large volumes in ob attracts price (because large amounts can be bought/sold without impacting price)
- identify suply testing
- pullbacks on low volume - pull back if not supported
- two assets correlated, and then not - create short + long positions
- trend trading
- buy and hold
- trade on news
- When the price drops where low and stays there for some time - buy (chances to drop lower are lower then go much higher)
> Buy when there's blood in the streets,
> even if the blood is your own.
>
> Barron Rothschild
After a major decline, the risk of further decline diminishes while the opportunity for maximum profit increases.
- If an asset fails to make a higher high - sign of weakness
- Arbitrage between exchanges
- buy new tokens not yet listed on major exchanges
- use rich lists to understand accumulation/distribution by large accounts
- find sentiment by looking at orderbook - more buy orders/volums = bull (count only long time standing orders)
- identify iceberg / real orders in order books by how they behave when price hit them
- only buy when many other traders are buying (hiding in the crowd)
- if price moves too quickly - stop entering the market
- if the broader market falls quickly - stop buying
- know orders priority - FIFO or by size?
- always keep orders to catch spike
- monitor liquidations
- Look for institutional activities
- advantages from market inefficiencies (not enough liquidity, price is not adjusting fast enough)
- use ichimoku cloud
- ride pumps
- trade break outs
- trade pull backs (rejections)
- exit on stop and buy deeper
- collect and combine signals from different sources
- wait for candlestick to close
- spot accumulation and distribution
- spot price is close to large volume clusters in order book those been there for long time
- spot price, volume and orders momentum increase
- analize executed orders
- buy in small amounts once price in range
- when price goes up and many sale orders coming - there is resistance
- look for loss of momentum (failed to make lower low or higher high, double top/double bottom)
- break out from penant
- candles getting shorter and shorter
- conside time and dow
- create zones, when enter - buy, exit - sell, enter next one - buy ...
- channel break out

Works:

- Trailing sell (trailing stop)
- Price/volume analysis

Options - financial contracts giving their owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a stated price (strike price) prior to or on a specified date.

## TA categories

TA categories:

- Objective
- Subjective

Subjective:

- classical chart pattern analysis
- hand-drawn trend lines
- Elliott Wave principle
- Gann patterns
- Magic T's

## Using bots

Finding patterns (chart formations).
Finding a better pair/a chain of pairs.
Placing forward.
Relying on signals.
Notifying of changes.
Using higher hights and higher lows to find primary trend.
If thend brokes, probably, something changed and we need to correct the strategy.

Bot trading strategies:

- Scalping strategy
- MACD strategy
- Stick it on rise

Bot examples:

- https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot
- Gunbot
- Leonardo (simpler than Gunbot)
- DA POWERPLAY

> Letâ€™s say I bought 10 bitcoins, and I want to sell them if the price reaches $1200. This can be done at exchanges already, of course. But using the bot, I can set it up to sell at $1200, buy back at $1000 and sell it all again at $1100. So I am building up a sequence of ordering events that must take place, and I define the exact target prices on it.

Client algorithmic trading infrastructure:

- communication with exchange (pulling market data and order entry)
- pulling historical market data
- risk management layer (handle errors, runaway trading)
- strategy implementation (quantitive part)
- visualization, analytics
- signal research framework

Trading signal also referred to as features, calculators, indicators, predictors, alpha.
Signals almost always originate from some intuitive idea and observation of certain market conditions.

ARIMA - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (find trend, seasonality, noise, and project future price).

### Why bot trading doesn't work well

Short - because of exchange fees.

If trade fast - there are small margins.
So if we sell with 0.6% profit, and pay 2 * 0.25% (for Bittrex), we have only 0.1% left.
That is the case when the trade was profitable.
In case of negative result: 2 * 0.25% + 0.6% - 1.1% lost.
So roughly for each fail we should have 11 wins at least to be profitable.

## Market mechanics

Large market rallies generate investor confidence, causing more participants to buy more, recursively causing larger rallies.

Large drops in market price scare off parcipants invested in the trading instrument, causing them to sell their holdings and exacerbate the drop.

What truly moves the price is AGGRESSION.
If the price goes up, then the buyers are more aggressive (they use market orders).

Many traders quit trades on break even.

There are bots in the market: arbitrage, mean reverse, etc.

The more visible setup (more clear, more time since formed), the more participants to expect.

## Testing

Backtest - test on historical data.

> Historical success is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for concluding that a method has predictive power and, therefore, is likely to be profitable in the future.
>
> Evidence-Based Technical Analysis by David Aronson

## Technical Analysis

> The charts don't lie.
>
> Charts really are the "foot-print of money". What some talking head on a financial news network might say becomes immaterial when you can look at a chart and see what the "money" is saying.
>
> Charting and Technical Analysis by Fred McAllen

Charts allow to see:

- past performance
- highs
- lows
- trends
- moving averages
- trading volume
- and more

Chart types:

- single line chart
- bar chart

### Candles

Shooting star candle - potential weakness. If see a few close - increasing bearish sentiment.

A long legged doji candle should always be validated by average, preferably high or ultra high volume.

If many people believe shooting star is bullish candle, it will be.

If no weak is created, then this signals strong market sentiment in the direction of the closing price.

### Market rotation

More risky stocks are sold and the money is moved into safer stocks.
Is is not because the safer stocks have room to advance, but because they are likely to hold their value better in an economic down-turn.

### Market weakness signs

Early signs:

- Lower volume on advances
- Higher volume on declines
- Inability to make higher highs
- Primary trend line broken
- DMA broken

Trend change signs:

- Lower highs, lower lows
- Higher volume on declines
- Low volume on advances

### Price action

Volume reveals whether the price action is valid or false.

Buying climax - when the market has moved sharply lower in a price waterfall and bearish trend,
supported by masses of volume. Wholesalers are buying and retail traders are panic selling.

Selling climax - at the top of a bull trend, where we see sustained high volumes.
Wholesalers are selling to retail traders and investors.

Phases (Charles Dow):
- accumulation
- public participation
- distribution

Smart money taking profits and selling to an increasingly eager public.

Wyckoff laws:
- The law of supply and demand (when demand is greater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and conversely when supply is greater than demand then prices will fall, with the over supply being absorbed as a result)
- The law of cause and effect (a small amount of volume activity will only result in a small amount of price action)
- The law of effort vs result (the price action on chart should reflect volume action)

Volume Price Analisys concepts:
- Accumulation
- Distribution
- Testing
- Selling Climax
- Buying Climax

Why markets move sideways:
- pending release of a fundamental news
- selling and buying climax (warehouses are either being filled or emptied by the insiders)
- run into old areas of price, where traders have been locked into weak positions in previous moves

SMA(50, 200) can become a support/resistance.

Divergence between volume and price: the volume of trading stops expanding and starts to shrink as the averages move to their final highs. Normally at the beginning of a move, the volume of trading continually grows. But then, at a certain point, the market makes new highs but the volume contracts.

Fibonacci retracement is a tool used to predict the pull-back of price after a period of growth based on a set of predetermined percentages: 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8, 78.6.

Fibonacci extension is a tool used to find targets for growth after a pull-back. Commonly used 161.8, 200.

Images for retracement, extension, expansion!

Combine fibonacci with trendlines and moving averages.

Institutional activities signs:
- Sideways price action area
- Aggressive initiation activity
- Strong rejection

Institutions have large amount of capital to trade.

Following a consistent set of actions leads to consistent results.

Success parts:
- consistency
- risk management
- edge in the market

> The most important rule of trading is to play great defense, not great offence.
>
> Paul Tudor Jones

Trading is about probabilities, never certainties.

## Order book

Large volume at price:
- often can be found on significant levels (round prices, support/resistance)
- large numbers of stop orders can be found behind large volumes (that can cause a price spike after the price is broken)
- makes send to put orders before large volumes, so there will be more chances for them to be executed
- makes sense to put stops behind large volumes, so there will be less chances for them to be executed
- price can be moved tovards large volumes by large players, and then they can consume large liquidity at good price and don't cause large price change
- large volumes can be removed or moved a bit (if the intension was just price manipulation without intent to buy/sell)
- large volumes can be executed with market order after removed from order book

## Volume profile

D - market is balanced. A sign of institutions accumulating volumes.
P - aggressive buyers. Ususally seen when market is in uptrend, at the possible end of downtrend.
b - aggressive sellers. Downtrend of end of uptrend.
thin - strong uptrend or downtrend.

## Risk management

Keep account at risk `~3-5%` per trade.
Account at risk = `((entry_price - stop_price) / stop_price) * quantity + fee`.
Sell asset gradually to reduce risk.
Let winners to run and cut losers.
Move stop (towards entry only) to reduce or remove risks later (ladder stop, trailing stop).

Improperly sized positions affects ability to be disciplined.

Sizing too large = more excited, frustrated, emotional, exhausted.

Sizing too small = disinterest, boredom, sloppiness, lack of returns.

Stop price can be calculated based on volatility (Average True Range can be used as a volatility indicator).

Booking partial gains as the asset is becoming profitable and raising stops to ensure profits do not become losses.

After a losing trade - take a break to reduce emotional decisions.
