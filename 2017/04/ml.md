# Machine learning

The basics of most machine learning:

- Start with a set of data that you know the answer to
- Train your machine learning algorithm on that data set, often known as the training set
- Get a set of data that you want to know the answer to, often known as the test set
- Pass that data through your trained algorithm and find the result

## Decision tree

## Random forest

A Swiss Army Knife of machine learning algorithms.
