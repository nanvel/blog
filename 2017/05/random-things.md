## Exceptions

> Do you keep an endpoint on your site that purposely causes an exception to test changes to 
exception handling? Asking for a friend.

## Naming conventions

Compound names: "from less specific to more specific" works best in the most cases.

## Directed acyclic graph

[Directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again. Equivalently, a DAG is a directed graph that has a topological ordering, a sequence of the vertices such that every edge is directed from earlier to later in the sequence.

See [airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/).

## Shifts in software engineering

The cloud has effectively knocked down the logistical and economic barriers to
accessing production-ready infrastructure. Any organization or individual can
now harness the same technologies powering some of the biggest companies in
the world (Monitoring Modern Infrastructure by John Matson and K Young).
