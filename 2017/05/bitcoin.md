# Bitcoin

[TOC]

Whether Bitcoin represents money is subject to debate, but that it is a currency, a medium of exchange, is indisputable.

> Bitcoin isn't money; it isn't a system of currency. It's not a company, it's not a product, it's not a service you sign up for. It's not a currency; currency is just the first application. It is the concept of decentralization applied to the human communication of value. It is a platform of trust.
