Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

!!! note "Infrastructure as Code"
    Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.

## Vocabulary

### Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IAC) - write and execute code to define, deploy, and update your infrastructure.
