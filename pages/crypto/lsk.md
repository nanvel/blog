# LSK

[TOC]

Lisk [Blog](https://blog.lisk.io/) | [Homepage](https://lisk.io/)

## Unique features

Lisk uses a simplified implementation of BitShares’ original consensus algorithm called Delegated Proof of Stake.

Only delegates (selected by voting) can earn rewards.

To send LSK from one account to another takes 10 seconds, after about 1–2 minutes the transaction can be deemed immutable.

Deploy your own sidechains with Lisk SDK (create application like online shops, games, financial applications, etc.).
