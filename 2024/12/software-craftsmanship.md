# Software craftsmanship

Subtle Rules of Software Engineering:

0. Stop falling in love with your own code 
1. You will regret complexity when on-call
2. Everything is a trade-off. There's no "best"
3. Every line of code you write is a liability
4. Document your decisions and designs
5. Everyone hates code they didn’t write
6. Don't use unnecessary dependencies
7. Coding standards prevent arguments
8. Write meaningful commit messages
9. Don't ever stop learning new things
10. Code reviews spread knowledge
11. Always build for maintainability
12. Ask for help when you’re stuck
13. Fix root causes, not symptoms
14. Software is never completed
15. Estimates are not promises
16. Ship early, iterate often
