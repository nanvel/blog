# Software craftsmanship

Subtle Rules of Software Engineering:

1. Stop falling in love with your own code 
2. You will regret complexity when on-call
3. Everything is a trade-off. There's no "best"
4. Every line of code you write is a liability
5. Document your decisions and designs
6. Everyone hates code they didn’t write
7. Don't use unnecessary dependencies
8. Coding standards prevent arguments
9. Write meaningful commit messages
10. Don't ever stop learning new things
11. Code reviews spread knowledge
12. Always build for maintainability
13. Ask for help when you’re stuck
14. Fix root causes, not symptoms
15. Software is never completed
16. Estimates are not promises
17. Ship early, iterate often
