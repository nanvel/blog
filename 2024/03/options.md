# Options

[TOC]

[Binance EU Options API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/voptions/en/#change-log)

Eutopean Style Options: can be exercised only at expiration.
American Style Options: can be exercised at any time prior to expiration.

Calls - options to buy.
Puts - options to sell.
Writing options = selling options.

Fees:

- transaction fee
- excercise fee

Strategies:

- Bying calls: bullish
- Selling calls: bearish (reading of position and receiving premium)
- Buying puts: bearish
- Selling puts: receiving premium and accumulating position in the asset
- Straddle: buying a Call and a Put Options of the same asset with identical Strike Prices and expiration dates
- Strangle: same as straddle, but Call and Put Options do not have the same Strike Prices
- Iron Condor
- [Butterfly](https://3commas.io/blog/butterfly-option-strategy)

Straddles work well when a trader believes an asset's price will move but is unsure in which direction so that they are protected regardless of the outcome. A strangle works well when an investor is certain of the direction of an asset's movement but would still like to hedge their position.

Spreads:
- Vertical spread - different strike price
- Horizontal spread - different expiration date
- Diagonal spread - both strike price and expiration dates are different
- bull call (basic vertical) - multi-leg call option strategy with both a right to buy and obligation to sell with the same expiration but different strikes
- bear put

Different strike price -> vertical spread.
Different expiration date -> horizontal spread.
Both -> diagonal spread.

## Greeks

**Delta**: the rate of change of the optionâ€™s price attributable to a given change in the price of the underlying instrument.
Positiove for calls (`0..1`) and negative for puts (`-1..0`).

**Gamma**: the rate of change of portfolio delta with a change in the underlying price.
A high value of gamma means that the delta is more sensitive to the share price changes and vice versa.
Gamma is always positive, and its value is highest when the option is near the money and close to expiration.
Puts and calls have equal gamma.

**Theta**: measures the sensitivity of the option value to a small change in calendar time.
Theta is usually negative for both a call and a put option as the expiration date gets nearer.

**Vega**: the sensitivity of a portfolio to a given small change in the assumed level of volatility.
The vega of both call and put options are equal and always positive.

**Rho**: the change in a portfolio with respect to a small change in the risk-free rate of interest.
Therefore, rho is positive for a call option and negative for a put option.
