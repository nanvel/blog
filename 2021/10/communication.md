# Communication

[TOC]

## Notes

Use `and` instead of `but`, stop using `but`!

Use `I want` instead of `I should`!

Every sentence should add value.

## Courtesies

I'm sorry to trouble you, ...
Would you be so kind as to ...
Won't you please ...
Would you mind ...
Thank You.

Well, now, look. I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Le's examine the facts.

## How to Win Friends & Influence People notes

**Handling people:**

- Don't criticize, condemn or complain
- Give honest and sincere appreciation
- Arose in the other person an eager want

> Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.
> Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

> I will speak ill of no man, and speak all the good I know of everybody.
>
> Benjamin Franklin

**Ways to make people like you:**

- Become genuinely interested in other people
- Smile
- Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language
- Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
- Talk in terms of the other person's interests
- Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely

> There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything:
> by making the other person want to do it.

> The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.
>
> John Dewey

> Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips.
> You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.

> Try to figure out the other person's good points.
> Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation.

> A smile says: I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.
>
> Smile - it costs nothing, but creates much.

> People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.

> There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
>
> Shakespeare

> Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers,
> but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.

**Win people to your way of thinking:**

- The only way to get best of an argument is to avoid it
- Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong"
- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically
- Begin in a friendly way
- Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately
- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking
- Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers
- Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view
- Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires
- Appeal to the nobler motives
- Dramatize your ideas
- Throw down a challenge

> The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.

**Be a leader:**

- Begin with prise and honest appreciation
- Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person
- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
- Let the other person save face
- Price the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to
- Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct
- Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest

> Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.

## Technical writing

To focus on:

- Focus each paragraph on a single topic
- State key points at the start of each document
- Identify your target audience
- Determine what your target audience already knows and what your target audience needs to learn
- State your document's scope (goals) and audience
- Break long topics into appropriate sections
- The vast majority of sentences in technical writing should be in active voice
