First hitchhiking experience and my birthday
--------------------------------------------

Partly because of I had no money and I needed to make borderrun, and partly because it was interesting for me, 2014.01.03 was my first hitchhiking experience, thanks to Genya it was successful and I had a lot of fun. Also this day I first time ate in Tony's restaurant on Chalong, and it become my favourite place to have a dinner on Phuket.

Level 33 at lingualeo
---------------------

Once I seen that professor from my university has level 33 at lingualeo, I thought: it's easy to beat this result for me. It took more than year to exceed this level.

New blog: nanvel.com
--------------------

I decide that it easier to write and store my blog posts in restructured text format than use rte. Blogging engine (gblog) still far not perfect, but it is enough for me.

Stop my university education
------------------------------

8 years in university it too much. And my university is under control of terrorists now. I decided that it is a right time to stop my university study, besides in last time I don't find anything interesting/useful for me in the university.

Plans for 2015
--------------

- Japan and Philippines
- Learn Thai language
- Get driver lessons
- Spend more time on own projects
- Learn AngularJS
- DynamoDB book
- Leave more time for sport/relax
