# Technical analysis

[TOC]

## Moving averages

A moving average (MA) is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the "noise" from random price fluctuations.

MAs:

- simple moving average (SMA)
- exponential moving average (EMA) (which gives greater weight to more recent prices)

Applications:

- identify the trend direction
- determine support and resistance levels
