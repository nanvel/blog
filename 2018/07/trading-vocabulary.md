## Market order vs limit order

The primary advantage of a limit order over a market order is that the limit order guarantees market entry at the trader's specified, desired price.

## Market phases

Market phases or stages of a trend:

- accumulation
- public participation
- distribution

Accumulation: insiders actively buying.
Public participation: technically oriented investors begin buying.
Distribution: uninformed investors and novices believe the market will continue going up.
The smart money and the dumb money swapping hands.

## Options

There are two basic types of options:

- Calls
- Puts 

## Order book, bid and ask

[Bitcoin Trading: Interpreting Order Books](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-trading-interpreting-order-books/)

An **order book** is a ledger containing all outstanding orders – instructions from traders to buy or sell bitcoin.

`bid` - an order to buy.

`ask` - an order to sell.

Order types:

- market order (buy or sell immediately for the best available price)
- limit order (buy or sell a set number of bitcoins at a specified price or better)

## Order book depth

Order book depth (total quantity of orders) can be used as a way to quantify the market’s intentions to buy and sell.

## Pump And Dump

Pump and dump is a scheme that attempts to boost the price of a stock through recommendations based on false, misleading or greatly exaggerated statements.

## Price

When demand is greater than supply, then prices will rise to meet this demand, and conversely, when supply is greater then demand, then prices will fall.

## Rich-List

The list of addresses found on a coin's block explorer that depicts the largest holders of that coin and their transactions.

## ROI

ROI - return-on-investment.

## Sell wall

A large investor might be trying to move the market.

Sell walls create an impression of a strong supply. This makes some people, unwilling to wait for the wall to break down, pitch their sales offers below the wall. By moving the wall closer to the current bid again, a large investor might be able to move the market to a small extent and then buy at a lower price. The investor's goal is to move the market, not to actually sell his supply at that price, so when the price gets too close, such walls often disappear or move to a higher price. Especially, if you see the same amount popping up at different prices, there is probably someone trying to move the market without actually fulfilling orders or bids.

See [What is the strategy behind a sell wall?](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/16918/what-%20is-the-%20strategy-behind-%20a-sell-%20wall).

If a trader wants to place orders at pre-determined price points, he can do so automatically without showing his orders on the books by using simple trading software. That said, there are some advantages that would lead a trader to reveal his intentions by placing large, public limit orders.
Large limit orders are often placed to advertise intention and to affect the distribution of orders around the wall. Traders will often move orders ahead of the wall to get executed first.

## Short selling the trend

Is one of the strategies to make money in a declining market.

Selling at the highs, buying back at the lows.

Margin account is required.

Land n shares -> return the same number later. But the price of them will be less.

## Stop Losses

If the price drops more than 6% to 8% then there is a valid reason for that much decline.

## Support and Resistance

These terms are used by traders to refer to price levels on charts that tend to act as barriers from preventing the price of an asset from getting pushed in a certain direction.

Price levels simply represent the "extreme" psychological levels of fear and greed.
Price consolidation creates invisible barriers which are then densely populated with both weak and strong groups of traders,
and which then become platforms either of support or resistance during future market activity.

Price levels those have historically been reliable points at which market participants have heavily bought or sold.

## Technical Analysis

Financial analysis that uses patterns in market data to identify trends and make predictions.

## Testing markets

Testing: the worst thing that can be happen to insiders is they begin to move the market higher but hit by waves of selling, which would drive the market lower undoing all the hard work of shaking the sellers.

## Trends

By time period: primary, secondary and minor.

The primary trend is the most important of the three tends. It is the granddaddy of the three trends, and will dictate whether you make money or not.

Volume confirms primary trend.

Significant lows or highs must be used to to draw a trend line.

## Volume

Volume is the total amount of anything swapped around in a certain period of time. An exchange usually shows it’s own volume for each crypto, that is the amount traded on that particular exchange, normally in the last 24hr unless it says otherwise.

Volume reveals whether the price action is valid or false:

- if a price was moving on low volume, then there could be many different reasons
- if a price move is associated with high or rising volume - a valid move
- if the price continue moving in one direction, with associated supporting volume - signal of the start of a trend

In a manipulated market, volume reveals the truth behind the price action.
In a pure market, volume reveals the truth behind market sentiment and order flow.

If the volume is low, then, clearly, the insiders are not buying at this level.
Break on low volume is a trap move.

## VPA

Volume-price analysis.

If the cause if large, then the effect will be large as well.

See also [Volume](#volume).

## Whales

Traders with massive amounts of the currency being traded. They are able to sell and buy in quantities large enough to manipulate the market price in the short term.
